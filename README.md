# applied-linear-algebra

These notebooks were created as part of my coursework to apply linear algebra concepts in practical and interesting ways.

## Notebooks Overview

1. **Linear Transformations and Neural Networks**  
   I explored the concept of linear transformations and connected them to neural networks. It was a mix of math and coding to see how these transformations play a role in building and understanding network structures.

2. **Webpage Navigation Model and PCA**  
   I worked on analyzing webpage navigation patterns using a simple model and applied PCA to reduce the dataâ€™s complexity.

3. **Gaussian Elimination**  
   I implemented Gaussian Elimination to solve systems of linear equations. It was a great hands-on way to reinforce the theory and understand how the method works step by step.
